bitset Changelog
================

Here you can see the full list of changes between each bitset release.

Version 1.4.0
-------------

Released on April 4th, 2013

- More speed optimizations, 'Data.BitSet.Dynamic' is close to 'Data.Set'
  performance on most operations.
- Added 'Data.BitSet.Word', a bit set with native integer as container
  type, significantly faster then 'Data.Set' for enumerated types with
  small number of constructors.
- Added folds, 'map' and 'filter' for consistency with other Haskell
  containers.

Version 1.3.0
-------------

Released on March 25th, 2013

- Added a generic bit set data type, abstract with respect to the underlying
  container.
- Improved dynamic bit set performance via optimized 'popCount' and
  'testBit' functions.

Version 1.2
-----------

Initial release, released on March 22th, 2013
